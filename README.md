## A website I built for my portfolio to show employers

In this project I worked on making a website that can display all my work and projects to help me get my work out there and be displayed in a enjoyable and easy to access manner for employers. 

### Things I worked on
-Built a nav bar with clickable links and linear-gradient background.

-created a main section with photos to display all my projects that are also clickable so you can easily access my work.

-built a footer page with all my contact info to make it easy to contact me.

-Condensed CSS files to look cleaner and more organized.
