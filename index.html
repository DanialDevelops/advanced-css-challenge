            Hi, my name is Danial Choudhry. I am currently attending the University of 
            Toronto's full-stack web development bootcamp to further my knowledge. I have had a 
            keen interest in programming and anything related to computers since I was young. 
            After some consideration, I decided it was time to pursue a career in this field, 
            and the first step was attending this bootcamp. As for me, I am a 19-year-old 
            student from Brampton, ON. I love playing sports, video games, and of course, 
            programming. I hope to one day travel the world and experience many different 
            things from all corners of the earth. 
            </p>
